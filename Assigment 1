//Comments on results:
//Results for this are as you'd expect as ints, int*, and longs are typically 4 bytes on x64 machine
//double returns 8 bytes also as expected as they also take up 8 bytes of memory on a x64 machine
//and finally the char is one byte which is also true as they only occupy 1 byte of space
